\multicolumn{4}{p{0.75\linewidth}}{\footnotesize Model 1 is a 2SLS regression that regresses new domestic manufacturing greenfield investment on Medicaid stimulus. Model 2 and 3 are OLS regressions that regress new domestic manufacturing greenfield investment on state-sponsored real and tax incentives respectively. * p$<$0.10, ** p$<$0.05, *** p$<$0.010}\\
